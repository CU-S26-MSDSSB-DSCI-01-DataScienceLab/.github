### Become a member of the organization ⭐

**As a registered student in the courses you must be a member of this organization!**

Steps to onboard you 👣 

1. The instructor, Jan Lorenz, will invite registered students based on the GitHub names known from the first semester. *Inform Jan Lorenz when you will not use your known GitHub account, but another one.* (You have to wait until this is done. Then GitHub will send you the invitation.)
2. **You have to accept the invitation which comes with an email from GitHub**
3. Now, you can access all repositories that will be created for you in this organization!
